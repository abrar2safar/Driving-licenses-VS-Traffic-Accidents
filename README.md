## Conclusions and Recommendations
* The highest rate of traffic accidents in Makkah region , Riyadh comes in second place .. unfortunately as accidents occurs injuries and deaths tend to occurs as well .
* while number of the driving licenses is not correlated with traffic accidents , yet Riyadh has the highest rate of issuing driving licenses I think its due to high population..
* a positive correlation between year and driving licenses means since 1993 to 2017 ,driving licenses also increased.. the highest was in Riyadh , Makkah then Eastern region again I think it may be correlated with population.
* an additional data would be really helpful such as population in each region , ticket records , the coordinate of the exact location of the accidents and season would be Helpful .
